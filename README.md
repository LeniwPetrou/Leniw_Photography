# Photo - Gallery Website

My first attempt of writing a *web based project*. 
The project is a *photo-gallery* about my personal photos and was built with **HTML** and **CSS**.

## Demo

The project has been deployed and you can check it out [here](https://leniwpetrou.github.io/photo-gallery-website-HTML-CSS/).


## Sneak Preview

Here is a **sneak preview** and some **highlights** of the project:
